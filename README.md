# CPRMiningBot
## A small script I wrote for Club Penguin Re-written that mines gold for you at the in-game mine :)
---
To use this bot: 
- join a low-player lever server in club penguin
- go to the in game mine
- run the bot script and type L in the input area
- hover the mouse over an empty area in the mine
- press enter to log that location
- repeat this process for around 3 times
- type S to start the bot and enjoy :)
---
> Side note: Make sure the locations you choose are close to each other so the bot can catch up while mining
